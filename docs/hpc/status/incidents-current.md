#### <span style="color: orange;">X2Go not working on GPU development nodes</span>

**Notice**: X2Go is currently broken on gpudev1 and pgpudev1. Symptom
is the session disconnects after successful authentication. We are
working on diagnosing the problem with the vendor. In the meantime,
please instead use port forwarding for GUI/Jupyter use of gpudev1 and
pgpudev1.
