#### <span style="color: orange;">Scheduler not available</span>

**Notice**: The job scheduler, SGE, does not respond to user requests,
e.g. `qstat` and `qsub`.  No new jobs can be submitted at this time.
The first reports on problems came in around 09:00 this morning.  We
are troubleshooting the problem.

#### <span style="color: orange;">X2Go not working on GPU development nodes</span>

**Notice**: X2Go is currently broken on gpudev1 and pgpudev1. Symptom
is the session disconnects after successful authentication. We are
working on diagnosing the problem with the vendor. In the meantime,
please instead use port forwarding for GUI/Jupyter use of gpudev1 and
pgpudev1.
